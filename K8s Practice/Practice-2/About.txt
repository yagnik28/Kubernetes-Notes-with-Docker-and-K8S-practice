This project is a Deployment Demo:

nginx-deployment.yaml file is used for configuration of the deployment and the configuration of pods of the deployment.

Then K8s itself adds "status" in the configuration to track the informations(done by etcd) and that new updated file nginx-deployment-result.yaml extracted from CLI.
