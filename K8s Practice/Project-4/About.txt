This project is a Demo Project for opening K8s-dashboard on domain name which is working as follows:


As we configure the k8s-dashboard-ingress.yaml the IP Address for the "host" written in the file will be assign for this Ingress.

User enters the K8s-dashboard.com and request comes to minikube cluster in the cluster it goes to ingress-controller-pod.

Which will go to Ingress and checks all the rules and according to that it sends the request to the kubernetes-dashboard service.
 
From kubernetes-dashboard service it goes to kubernetes-dashboard pod.
